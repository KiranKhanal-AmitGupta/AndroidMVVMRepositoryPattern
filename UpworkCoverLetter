Hello,

I am an Android Developer with an experience of almost 4 years. My professional history includes positions such as Senior Android Developer at various IT companies in Nepal including Products and Service companies. 
I have recently started working on Upwork.

PlayStore:https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=amitgupta1994

I do and prefer projects with Kotlin, Java with clean architecture + MVVM pattern.

Talking About This Project :
This project seems to have video/live streaming as its core functionality.
I have a ton of experience building OTT (Over The Top )apps, Android STB(Set-Top Box ) apps,  and apps for Android Tv.

Here is the link for CustomVideo Player Project(Library) which I am currently self-building(its almost complete).
https://github.com/AmitGupta1994/videoplayer-android

Plus, you can check(Github) and ask for more clean-architecture projects, if required. Please, feel free to ask for any required information if I have missed any.

However, let me mention I am not a great UI Developer, so if its a very UI Heavy application, then it's not for me, I guess.

I look forward to speaking with you further regarding your available position and regarding more about the project.

Sincerely,
Amit Gupta















Hello,

I am an Android Developer with an experience of almost 4 years. My professional history includes positions such as Senior Android Developer at various IT companies in Nepal including Products and Service companies. 
I have recently started working on Upwork but have done remote working though for local clients in Nepal.

I prefer projects with Kotlin, Java with clean architecture + MVVM pattern.
Also, I maintain unit tests using JUnit, Mockito, and Instrumentation tests using Expresso.
I am learning to use Roboelectric though for fast Instrumentation and UI tests.

Talking About This Project :
I have been using Kotlin for almost 2 years now, I have experience using the SQLite database using Room as well as using the Helper class methods.
I use POSTMAN and Swagger for testing APIs before integration into the App. I am aware of using Environments and testing in Postman. However, I have not used the new GraphQL feature though.
And for my own growth, I make APIs using spring MVC and spring boot, and this has helped me to gain more knowledge regarding SQL databases using ORM.
And the thing that has helped me as an Engineer is being good at Algorithms and Data Structures, which has made my problem-solving skills always better.

I am applying because I fell the work is for the intermediate-senior level. The technologies and tools required here match the ones I have experience with. Thus, I fell that do the task in the way you would desire.

I hope I will make to the Interview process.
I look forward to speaking with you further regarding your available position and regarding more about the project.

Hello,

I am an Android Developer with experience of above 4 years.

Talking About This Project :
I am skilled and experience at most of the tools and technologies the Project asks for(Java, Kotlin, Firebase, Google Maps and its Apis, GeoFence, Location Apis.). However, the only thing I would say I do not have complete experience is Firebase Auth. But, that should not be a big problem I guess because for a developer there is always room to grow.

I am looking forward to having a Talk with you in your available time so that we can discuss If I Fit for the Project.

More Detail About Me and My Work :
To keep it short, I love doing projects with Kotlin, Java, based on clean architecture + MVVM pattern.

However, My experience includes the following Tools and Technologies :
MVP architecture pattern, Retrofit2, Co-Routines, Room, Realm, Firebase, Firestore, etc, and a lot more. 

I use POSTMAN and Swagger for testing APIs before integrating them into the App.

Also, I maintain unit tests using JUnit, Mockito, and Instrumentation tests using Expresso.
I am learning to use Roboelectric though for fast Instrumentation and UI tests.

Talking About This Project :
Along with writing clean code, I am good at Code Review, Code Refactoring, and Architecting the Code/System.

I am skilled and experience at most of the tools and technologies that an Android Project needs(Java, Kotlin, Firebase, Google Maps, and its Apis, GeoFence, Location Apis, Authentication, Youtube Apis. and so on).

I am looking forward to having a talk with you in your available time so that we can discuss If I am a Fit for this project and we can talk about my hourly rates as well. I am really looking forward to working with long term client.

My experience includes the following Tools and Technologies :
MVP architecture pattern, Retrofit2, Co-Routines, Room, Realm, Firebase, Firestore, etc, and a lot more. 

I use POSTMAN and Swagger for testing APIs before integrating them into the App.

Also, I maintain unit tests using JUnit, Mockito, and Instrumentation tests using Expresso.
I am learning to use Roboelectric though for fast Instrumentation and UI tests.

And for my own growth, I make APIs using spring MVC and spring boot and deploy them using AWS CodeStar and this has helped me to gain more knowledge regarding SQL databases using ORM and CI/CD.
And the thing that has helped me as an Engineer is being good at Algorithms and Data Structures, which has made my problem-solving skills always better.

NOTE: Since I have recently started working on Upwork, I am looking at building my Profile, that's why I am working at minimum Rates.

Please, check my sample codes and designs attached.

Amit Gupta
